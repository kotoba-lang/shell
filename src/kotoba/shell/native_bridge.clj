(ns kotoba.shell.native-bridge
  "The in-app provider bridge: native provider implementations that ship
  *inside* a scaffolded app, plus the policy asset that governs them.

  This is a different thing from `native-host`, and the difference is the
  whole point. `native-host run`/`native-host provider` execute providers
  through `bin/kotoba-shell-host-{macos,ios,android}` — for iOS and Android
  those are `xcrun simctl spawn booted` and `adb shell`, which are a
  developer's machine driving an attached device. Nothing in that path exists
  in an `.ipa` or `.apk` handed to someone else, so before this namespace the
  provider catalog's `:required-targets [:macos :ios :android :windows]` was
  true only of the CLI, never of a shipped build.

  The templates live in `resources/kotoba/shell/app/` rather than as string
  literals here, following `keychain_cacao_app_delegate.swift`: Swift and Java
  that is read as Swift and Java can be compiled, diffed and linted on its
  own, and a `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` is visible in a way string concatenation is
  not.

  Policy is carried into the app as JSON (`:json-role :interop`, the same
  convention the provider catalog already declares) because the native side
  has JSONSerialization and org.json built in and no EDN reader. EDN remains
  canonical: the JSON is generated from the same `:allow`/`:deny` map the CLI
  evaluates, and both native implementations reproduce
  `kotoba.shell.launcher/policy-decision` exactly."

  "Commands the in-app bridge implements natively on every target it supports.

  Deliberately the portable subset. `contacts/list`, `calendar/list-events`
  and `webauthn/*` are macOS-only in the provider catalog and stay that way:
  each needs a real Contacts/EventKit/AuthenticationServices integration per
  platform, and listing them here would repeat the exact mistake the catalog
  already had to correct — claiming iOS/Android support with no
  implementation behind it."
